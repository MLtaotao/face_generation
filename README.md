# face_generation
Using GAN to generate some amazing images

Introduction
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the face_generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

Submission
Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.
Ensure you pass all points on the rubric.
When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the File menu in the notebook and choosing "Download as" > HTML. Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together.
Package the "dlnd_face_generation.ipynb", "helper.py", "problem_unittests.py", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.
